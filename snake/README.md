# Summary

For this recreation, the Turtle module was used to power the UI and the game objects. 
The speed of the game is controlled via time.sleep found in the while loop in main. A lower sleep value will make the game faster and a higher value will make the game slower. 

## Movement

This recreation uses WASD movement keys, but it can be changed fairly easily in main.

## High Scores

High scores are maintained locally in a generated file called data.txt.
